This is a random text generator project that I made for fun.
It is a simple program that generates random text.
The source of the text can be:
- a test '.txt' file included the dopository (a Game of Thrones script)
- a text file of the user's choice
The input text is nalyzed and the programm generates a report.
The report contains:
- the number of words in the text
- the number of sentences in the text
- the number of unique words in the text
- Most common named entities
- Most common nouns

The program generates a library of words that is used to generate text, and as a bonus offers to generate text with a particular word or name.
The program is written in python and uses a Spacy library for the text processing.
