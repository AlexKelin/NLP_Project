This is a random text generator project that I made for fun.
The program needs an input file to take as a language source.
- a test '.txt' file included the depository (a Game of Thrones script)
- a text file of the user's choice
The input text is analyzed, and the program generates a report.
The report contains the following:
- the number of words in the text
- the number of sentences in the text
- the number of unique words in the text
- Most commonly named entities
- Most common nouns

The program generates a library of words that is used to generate text, and, as a bonus, it offers to create text with a particular word entity or name.
The program is written in python and uses a Spacy module for text processing.
