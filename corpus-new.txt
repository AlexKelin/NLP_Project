What do you expect? They're savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they're ripping each other to pieces.
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I've never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
How close did you get?
Close as any man would.
We should head back to the wall.
Do the dead frighten you?
Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.
You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again.
Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
They were here.
See where they went.
What is it?
It's …
Go on. Father's watching.
And your mother.
Fine work, as always. Well done.
Thank you.
I love the detail that you've managed to get in this corners. … Quite beautiful … the stitching …
And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.
Don't think too much, Bran.
Relax your bow arm.
Quick, Bran, faster!
Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.
Get the lads to saddle their horses.
Do you have to?
He swore an oath, Cat.
The law is law, my lady.
Tell Bran he's coming, too.
Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
Lad, go run back and get the rest.
White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.
I know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry.
nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block.
Forgive me, lord.
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …
Don't look away.
King of the Andals and the First Men …
Father will know if you do.
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.
You did well.
You understand why I did it?
Jon said he was a deserter.
But do you understand why I had to kill him?
Our way is the old way?
The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
So he was lying?
A madman sees what he sees.
What is it?
Mountain lion?
There are no mountain lions in these woods.
It's a freak.
It's a direwolf.
Tough old beast.
There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
Now there are five.
You want to hold it?
Where will they go? Their mother's dead.
They don't belong down here.
Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.
Right. Give it here.
NO!
Put away your blade.
I take orders from your father, not you.
Please, father!
I'm sorry, Bran.
Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
What about you?
I'm not a Stark. Get on.
What is it?
The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow.
As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you
And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.
There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools.
What if Jon Arryn told someone?
But who would he tell?
My husband.
If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.
You should be the Hand of the king.
That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.
I wonder if the old gods agree.
It's your gods with all the rules.
I am so sorry, my love.
Tell me.
There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
Your sister. The boy …
They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
He's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after.
You can always say no, Ned.
We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
I'm told he drinks all night.
How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
In any case, candles.
Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!
I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
How many times have I told you
But he's coming right now! Down our road!
I want you to promise me
I promise.
D'you know what?
What?
You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?
Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]
Move!
Your Grace.
You've got fat.
Cat!
Your Grace.
Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.
Where's the Imp?
Will you shut up?
Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?
Arya.
Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.
That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
Would you please shut up.
My queen.
My queen.
Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.
Ned.
Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
Tell me about Jon Arryn.
One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.
We both did.
He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.
Aye.
Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.
I'm not worthy of the honor.
I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses.
Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
I did hear something about that.
And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
And the other brother?
The queen has two brothers?
There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
I hear they call him the Imp.
I hear he hates that nickname.
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
Clever girl.
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
Have you?
The gods gave me one blessing.
Don't get up.
M'lord.
Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.
She has odd cravings, our sister.
A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people.
I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.
I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown.
Close the door!
Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
She belonged with me.
In my dreams, I kill him every night.
It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.
Not all of them.
Daenerys!
Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?
No.
When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.
It's too hot, my lady.
Where is he?
The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.
Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.
Come forward, my dear.
Where's he going?
The ceremony is over.
But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know.
It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
When will they be married?
Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
Is it true they lie with their horses?
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
Do you take me for a fool?
I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
I don't know.
We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took.
Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
He's so handsome.
When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
Sansa…
Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted.
Is he dead yet?
Uncle Benjen!
You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
So take me with you when you go back.
Jon…
Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.
The Wall isn't going anywhere.
I'm ready to swear your oath.
You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
I don't care about that.
You might, if you knew what it meant. … I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later.
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
What're you doing back there?
Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?
Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.
What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.
He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
The two he was with are still missing.
A wildling ambush.
Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
Winter is coming.
Uncle Benjen.
Robb boy. How are ye?
I'm good.
Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
Yes. Lovely country.
I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?
Thirteen, Your Grace.
You're tall. Still growing?
I think so, Your Grace.
And have you bled yet?
No, Your Grace.
And your dress. Did you make it?
Such talent. You must make something for me.
I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
I hear the same.
Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
Your pardon.
I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.
I don't fight in tournaments.
No? Getting a little old for it?
I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do.
Well said.
Arya!
Time for bed.
I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital.
I won't let him take you.
The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
I'll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'
How did he get so fat?
He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
It's Maester Luwin, my lord.
Send him in.
Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.
Stay.
This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
What news?
She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying.
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?
If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.
He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
A different time. Different king.
When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.
When?
When their omens favor war.
I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.
Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.
Thank you, Magister.
She's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki.
There is no word for ‘thank you' in Dothraki.
Make him happy.
No.
Do you know the Common Tongue?
Is ‘no' the only word that you know?
Rough night, Imp?
If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.
I didn't pick you for a hunter.
The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
It's not hunting if you pay for it.
Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
No, but I'm still better than you.
I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
I hope I'll serve you well.
You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!
Come on, you.
Stop. STOP.
Are you completely mad?
He saw us.
It's all right. It's all right.
He saw us!
I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?
Ten
Ten.
The things I do for love.
You need to drink, child... And eat.
Isn't there anything else?
The Dothraki have two things in abundance
Khaleesi!
Your hands.
We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.
I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
As you wish, your Grace.
Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?
Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.
Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.
Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
What good will my sympathies do them?
None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
One word and I'll hit you again.
I'm telling mother!
Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?
You can't...
Do you understand?
The Prince will remember that, little lord.
I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...
Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.
Little brother.
Beloved siblings.
Is Bran going to die?
Apparently not.
What do you mean?
The Maester says the boy may live.
It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.
Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.
Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.
Please.
I would have dressed, your Grace.
This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.
I never knew.
It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
I am grateful..
Perhaps this time she'll listen.
A sword for the wall?
I already have one.
Good man. Have you swung it yet?
Of course I have.
At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
Is it "we" already? Have you taken your vows then?
Soon enough.
Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.
Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. "My things weren't properly folded", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.
It's good you've got help.
Watch. Nymeria, gloves.
Impressive.
Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!
I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
A present?
Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
It's so skinny.
So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
I can be quick.
You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
I think so.
First lesson
I know which end to use.
I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.
Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
I came to say goodbye to Bran.
You've said it.
I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.
I want you to leave.
17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
I have no choice.
That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.
You can. You must.
You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
You Starks are hard to kill.
My mother?
She was very kind.
Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.
It was always my color.
Farewell, Snow.
And you, Stark.
There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.
Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?
The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.
Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
I've half a mind to go with you.
What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
You should have asked me 20 years ago.
There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.
I recall a few chances.
There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
Bessie. She was one of yours.
Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?
Wylla.
That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
Nor will I.
We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.
The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.
Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
She's little more than a child.
Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
Tell me we're not speaking of this.
Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?
This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.
Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.
He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.
There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.
Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
Why do you read so much?
Look at me and tell me what you see.
Is this a trick?
What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
Until your brother killed that King.
Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?
Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.
The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.
It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
Talk to Poole about it.
Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...
I don't care about appointments!
I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
Very good, my Lord. My Lady.
When was the last time you left this room?
I have to take care of him.
He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...
Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
No!
Have you ever seen a dragon?
Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
Everywhere? Even in the east?
No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
It is known.
A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
The moon?
He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.
How old were you?
I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
Nine?!
I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.
Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
Yes.
Will it take three years?
No.
Welcome.
What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
The boy was always sure-footed before.
Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
Saw what, my lady?
I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.
They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.
What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.
I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
I'll ride to King's Landing.
No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
Mother, you can't.
I must.
I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
What about Bran?
I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
Finish a man?
Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
Pardon me, Ser.
Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.
I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?
He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.
Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
I'll get you!
Arya!
What are you doing here? Go away.
Your sister? And who are you, boy?
Mycah, my Lord.
He the butcher's boy.
He's my friend.
A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.
She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.
I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.
And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?
Stop it!
Arya, stay out of this.
I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!
I'll gut you, you little cunt!
Nymeria!
Please don't.
Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
Then go! Don't touch me.
The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
It's a direwolf.
I'll check down here.
I think I heard a noise.
Go!
My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
Where is she?
She's been taken directly before the King.
Who took her?
The Lannisters found her.
Right, get back.
The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
Back! Back to the inn. All back!
